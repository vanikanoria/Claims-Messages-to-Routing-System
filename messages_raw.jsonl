I also was concerned and confused about filling the paperwork out about the past 10 years of drs l have seen which has nothing to do with school .

As of Monday, April 29, Riverdale Medical had not received any results or feedback from ClearView Imaging regarding the MRI (which was late Friday so I wasn't surprised). I am concerned that it will be 4 weeks post-injury before anyone actually looks at imaging of the injury to determine an accurate diagnosis. As of now they are treating it as a wrist sprain, but one of the doctors at Riverdale Medical said it could be a fracture, possibly a ligament/tendon tear, which would indicate a different treatment protocol. I'm no spring chicken anymore and I can't afford to have long term effects due to misdiagnosis or improper treatment protocol.\n\nAll that being said, are the physicians at Riverdale Medical communicating with you what the treatment plan is? I really like the facility and the people there but worry about the lack of imaging and urgency to figure out exactly what the extent of the injury is.\n\nAny feedback or guidance is much appreciated! If I just need to be more patient I can do that 😊\n\nThank you so much,\n\nSarah"}

I had called them to get a referral to see an Orthopedist. They told me that I need to contact my w/c claims adjuster for the referral as the doctor does not see a need for me to go. I was not happy with that response. The last visit I had at that Urgent care place the doctor just went over my MRI results. They did not examine me or ask me anything about my pain. They basically told me I have arthritis and nothing more they can do. Again, they never asked me how I was feeling (pain wise) that day or examined me. I see on their paperwork they handed me on the way out they have it stated that my pain has resolved. THAT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT THE CASE AT ALL. So I am not happy. I have pain and have had pain since the day of the incident. I did NOT have any issues before. I have pain everyday, as I am typing this to you now my hand is kiling me. No Joke!! When I use my mouse, my hand hurts, when I (to be polite I will state it this way) when I use the 'facilities' the motion of cleaning myself hurts my hand. This is not a joke I did not have these issues before and now I do and they want to blame it on arthritis that I have but it did not bother me before this incident. I was having breakfast and I couldn't even hold a cup of coffee without supporting it with my other hand when drinking it. When I use my computer, my calculator etc. at work, my hand hurts. Am I working?? Yes, BUT it Hurts and it didn't before and I have just kind of been left with no solution at this point. All I did was hold the door open for somebody trying to be polite and this is how I am left?? I don't get it. Any help you can provide would be very much appreciated!! Thank you for your time, Sarah.

Upon arrival, the truck was parked and left running while EMS personnel went to retrieve the patient being transferred. The patient was placed safely onto the ambulance by stretcher. I noticed the vehicle was off after we had the truck running initially, so I turned on the vehicle, and after a few minutes of the truck running the truck started to smoke heavily at 2115 on May 10, 2024. I turned off the truck and proceeded to help get the patient out of the truck and notify the EMS 103 supervisor. Another unit was dispatched (medic 21) to transfer our patient to the receiving facility while I was told to take the truck back to the garage and switch out for truck 3050. Acknowledging the fact that the truck still presented smoke and a terrible burning smell. EMT Basic Rodriguez and I drove the truck and while en route to the garage, the vehicle stayed smoking with the burning smell, even with the windows down in the truck. Upon arrival at the garage, the equipment had to have been transferred to the receiving truck. Smoke was still prominent as I continued to get gear out of that truck and give it to my partner for her to put it on the new truck. My partner at the time also had a headache, just not as severe as my symptoms. After transferring the gear to the new truck we had parked the old truck. We were dispatched to another interfacility transfer from Memorial Hospital to City General Hospital. I did notify the supervisor that I did not feel well at 2220 about symptoms. After arriving at Memorial Hospital, I spoke with the Charge nurse Susan Wilson about my signs and symptoms while waiting for additional paperwork to transport the patient from the hospital staff. Before, during, and after that call my symptoms worsened with one of the worst headaches I have ever had. My throat and eyes began to hurt with a burning sensation. After transferring the patient EMS 103 supervisor was made aware of the situation by my partner and myself. I stated to EMS 103 Supervisor that I would continue to monitor for worsening effects and notify him in the morning about my status. After arriving at EMS base around 1230am and finishing the PCR, I had my own personal OTC Tylenol at 0100 on May 11, 2024, I took one tablet which was 500mg, and continued to stay hydrated with water.\n\nAfter sleeping for a about nearly 5 hours due to no calls from dispatch, I woke up feeling very bad. My headache was not as severe however my throat burned. I was notified by EMS 102 Assistant Chief about completing a Worker's Compensation form and detailed statement. I did contact the Assistant Chief about my signs and symptoms worsening and that I would be going to Pine Valley Medical Center by my home due to Employee Health being closed for the weekend. I explained to the doctor about what had happened and requested advice on my throat since my chest pain had subsided. I had no chest pain when arriving to Pine Valley Medical Center in Rivertown, NC. The doctor stated that I had some smoke inhalation and irritation. The doctor advised that I stay away from any form of smoke for 2-3 days and that I should stay hydrated, take some Tylenol for pain, and rest. There was nothing the doctor could do to help with the irritation, he stated that it should go away in a few days. I notified the Assistant Chief of the ER visit. He stated to get some rest and submit the paperwork as soon as possible.\n\nA follow-up appointment has not been made due to my signs and symptoms improved. I am feeling alot better and i am able to return to work. I am a part time employee and the next scheduled shift was scheduled on May 19th for 12hrs.\n\nI have a medical history of back and neck pain due to military service.
