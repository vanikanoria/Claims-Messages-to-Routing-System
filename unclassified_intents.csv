I just saw the ortho and he recommends surgery and wants to schedule it for Wednesday.
There is no policy number so make sure to tell them it is workers compensation and not a regular insurance.
A referral was sent to MedWell Health Center for physical therapy. Please contact them to schedule. 555.123.4567
"I didn't hear back from you, but I spoke to the dispatcher last night and she was putting in a request for the Wheelchair.

She said she was going to call you all."

Still have heard nothing about PT. Have another follow-up Thursday 12/21.
As of 1/8/24 still have heard nothing regarding physical therapy.
The issue was that they had the wrong phone numbers and no email listed. The phone numbers they tried were from YEARS ago. Any idea where they got these numbers? I gave them the phone numbers and my email. Let's see how these work.
"Excellent! Glad you were able to get it straightened out. the numbers would come from what your employer listed in your First Report of Injury.

Have a great day,

STILL have heard nothing. And no one here at my place of employment states that they know where these phone numbers came from. They said that the numbers used initially are current.
Perfect. Thank you

Not good at typing this morning. Let me know if you need anything else.

I am not worried about those documents at the moment. I want to make sure you are getting the treatment you need first.
That sounds helpful. Thank you. I don't see it attached to the claim I'm working. I note you have had prior claims. I wonder if it got attached to one of those by mistake. When did you have this conversation with the secretary? I'm happy to go look but if I know when it may have been done it might make this process a bit faster. Thank you for your help.

"If you are not comfortable with filling out the Authorization to Release Medical Records form that is your prerogative. There is nothing in the Statute that states you must complete the list of Doctors over the last 10 year period. We are a full care WC facility for Northern Valley School District. The completion of the forms prevents delays in obtaining optimal medical treatment for the specificity of the injured worker with certain medical conditions, prior history of medical treatment to the same body part, etc. Most specialists will NOT see a patient without a medical history. What is required is your signature on the fraud statement. That is a legality that doesn't only represent WC but Fraud in its entirety. Hope that helps."

Please see the four uploaded documents and reimburse my mileage.
"I received the attached bill for $944.24 from FirstResponse Ambulance Service. MedCorp needs to pay for it because all costs related to my workplace injuries are the sole responsibility of your company.

Approximately thirty-six hours after my June 4, 2024 surgery, I experienced symptoms that I believed to be related to a heart attack. FirstResponse Ambulance Service transported me to the ER at Clearwater Regional Hospital. After a CT scan, the physicians determined that I had anesthesia-related pneumonia; therefore, my trip to the ER was due to a post-surgical complication.

MedCorp needs to send me or FirstResponse a check for $944.24 as soon as possible. Let me know how you will resolve this matter."
"Also, your six mileage reimbursement forms, dated 05/16-08/30/2024, are currently in line for payment."

I'll call you by 230.
Dr. Smith completed the paperwork we just received it. I will have the nurse work on the surgery authorization now. Just wanted to keep you updated.
Dr. Wilson's office was informed at 10:55 AM when all the proper paperwork was provided.
All scheduled and good to go. I truly appreciate all of the work you did to get this done on time.
Happy Holidays!
They didn't leave one. I will look but I tried calling earlier as well to figure out the pre procedure protocol and got voice mail only.
Got the authorization email. Much appreciated.
I hope that works as i am not having luck with any of the numbers they keep sending me to. Thank you John. Have a great weekend.
Perfect!

I don't have Medicare does that count as refusal to provide info
"Sarah, if you recall in the documentation there was a 2nd /3rd visit that night  it was documented in my required letter.  but I did not see it reflected.  it was noted as an alergic reaction post accident.  I did pursue getting blood allergy tests done which came out negative.  Apparently I do not recall the medical term but the stress of the accident induced an anaphylactic shock (which resulted in severe respiratory difficulty)  for which I went to Meadowbrook Hospital 2 hours later which subsequently tripped my heart into AFIB and forced a several day stay in ICU.  You have access to all of my records including the Allergy tests done.  it was noted because it was so unusual and my regime is pretty rigid so it made no sense what caused such a severe allergic reaction."
