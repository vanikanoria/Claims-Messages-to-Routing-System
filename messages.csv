The second check is for $591.76 for weeks 2/15/23-2/28/23. And the third is for the first week you were unable to work 1/25/23-1/31/23 $295.88. Under workers comp, you cannot be paid for the initial week you were unable to work until you have missed more than 21 days, which you have at this point. I realize this was a lot of information so if you have any questions, please let me know."

Can you confirm if the hearing issues are just the left ear or both ears? Have you had any treatment under the claim yet? Have you missed any time from work due to the accident? Have you had any prior hearing issues?"

Since no treatment has been sought yet, next steps would be for you to have an initial evaluation at MedFirst Urgent Care (123 Main Street Suite 2 Riverdale, FL 34748). 
This will be your authorized treating facility under the claim and any further recommendations would have to come from the doctors there. If you are referred out for any specialty treatment (ex: diagnostic testing, medical eqiupment, specialty doctors), just let me and I'll get it set up."

Your claim was transferred to me yesterday. We did receive the information from the neurologist. The Nurse Case Manager on your claim has approved your MRI. You should be getting a call from Premier Medical to get scheduled for that test.

For the first 10 days you are out of work the School Board will pay you your regular wages in your regular paycheck. I have been advised you were paid by the School Board through yesterday 10/2/24. Beginning today I will address payment to you for time out of work under workers' compensation. At this time, I have requested your wage verification from the School Board. Once that is received, I will reach out to you about the amount of your payments that will be issued. Your workers' compensation check is scheduled to go out before 10/16/24.

Do you have any questions at this time?

The MRI showed that I have degenerative disks, yes that comes with old age. I'm sure if most people my age got an MRI it would show the same thing. However, before I held out my arm to stop my student from eloping, I did not have tingling or numbness down my arm. I also continued working after the incident and had to continue to stop him from eloping, not once did I not perform my job. I went through workmans comp to have my medical taken care of being that my pain was due to this job. So why am I being denied?

We do not cover second opinion appointments and your PCP is not covered under WC. You do have the option of a one-time change.

If I'm released back to work I will be straight there after apptmt. My head still hurts directly in the center of my forehead. I take Tylenol regularly to stay on top of it. But it's not going away. It makesme very nauseas. From what I read, i need a nerve block maybe. I can do that outside of workers comp if it needs too. I can't afford to lose pay.

184,2023-01-31 16:49:46,claimant,The doctor that saw me yesterday was totally incompetent. He left my room without examining me telling me I needed physical therapy and medication because it was still swollen. After he had left the room approximately 3 minutes later he came back then did a range of motion with my knee. Because of his lack of capability I almost left so that I could be seen by my own doctor. If I have to go back and be seen by him I will leave.
184,2023-01-31 16:50:55,claimant,The other 2 doctors actually did an exam to see my range of motion before making a determination. Yesterday's evaluation was from a doctor that could not even read the MRI diagnosis.

Claim Adjuster"
211,2023-03-15 16:02:42,claimant,"Hi Sandra, 
I went to the QuickCare in Pine Grove (Commerce Cir) initially. They did not have X-rays available there, so they sent us to Summit Urgent Care - Riverdale for the X-rays. Once the X-rays were done, they sent them to the doctor at the Pine Grove QuickCare to analyze them."
211,2023-03-17 15:03:40,claimant,"Hi Sandra,
Just checking in to see if there is any more information you need from me at the moment."
211,2023-03-27 16:02:22,claimant,"Hi Sandra, 
I just finished my MRI appointment. They said they will send the results to my doctor. I am wondering who I will get the results from? Will it be the doctor that I first saw at urgent care?
Also, I was wondering if you had any information on possible assistance with childcare. My husband will be out of town for about a week and a half starting this Friday, as I mentioned in my voicemail. We have a babysitter that my son is used to, and she said she would be available to stay with me while my husband is away to help me since I can't pick my son up. We will have to pay her and we're wondering if there was a way to get financial compensation for that. Thank you so much, have a good day."
211,2023-03-27 16:40:39,claimant,"Also, the person from the scheduling office mentioned that my form said ""stat"" for scheduling. Will this also affect how soon we get the results from the mri? The mri technician mentioned it may take 3-4 days."

I went ahead and called Metro Imaging as told to schedule the appointment with them. I spoke with Jane at 2:37pm today.

225,2025-02-13 16:23:27,claimant,I was filling out the document on what happened and it closed without me finishing it.
225,2025-02-18 16:59:02,superAdjuster,"Hello, how are you feeling? Do you have time for me today to call you for an initial contact? Have you been back to MedExpress since your ER visit?"
225,2025-02-18 16:59:36,superAdjuster,I am not worried about those documents at the moment. I want to make sure you are getting the treatment you need first.
225,2025-02-19 16:36:23,claimant,Hi Sarah I hurt on my follow up with MedExpress I was referred to a neurologist because of the headaches. Do you get the neurologist or me?
225,2025-02-19 17:21:58,claimant,Sarah I am not sure of what's going on. I went to MedExpress and was referred to a neurologist so I assumed I was not released from workman's comp cause if I was released workman's comp would not pay for the neurologist. If you can please call me.
226,2023-10-13 17:37:21,claimant,Hi Ms. Johnson this is Ms. Smith checking to see do you know when I'll get the MRI done because the said she wanted done within 3 day. Thanks

226,2023-10-19 16:42:22,claimant,Hi Johnson yes I saw the email and I also informed the secretary to send them because I gave all the paperwork to her. And she haven't been in this week. But she told me when I asked her she said she did and I gave her your name. So I will not know what happen to I speak with her. Unless it's something else I can do?
226,2023-10-19 17:06:52,adjuster,That sounds helpful. Thank you. I don't see it attached to the claim I'm working. I note you have had prior claims. I wonder if it got attached to one of those by mistake. When did you have this conversation with the secretary?

I'm attaching a photo of myself on 6-23-22 and I would not have been able to effectively do my job with no vision in my left eye.

I know doctor deemed that I was not fully able to work but also not that I couldn't go to work either. I am being asked to still go in the bus. Yes I am not to push or lift or do some of my regular job duties, however being on the road in such movement hurts my neck, hip and everything else even more. It is not safe for me until all my imagining is done, not just X-rays. I have now gotten two injections for the pain and I just keep being told to still go in the bus just to not lift or push and if I don't then it's coming out of my personal days and that is just not how it works."

264,2022-06-27 16:51:14,adjuster,"Good afternoon, 
I am sorry to hear that. We understand that your treatment will need to be put on hold. I hope you feel better soon! As part of the workers compensation process, I will need to complete an initial contact with you. It takes about 15 minutes. I understand if you are not feeling well and would like to wait on this. If you would like to wait for a later date to complete this please reply back to this email and I will put a note in your file to reach out again at the end of the week. If you are up to getting the initial contact done I can call you this afternoon after 3pm if that is OK with you. 
Again I hope you feel better soon! Please reach out if there is anything else you need!
Thank you,

Dear Michael R. Thompson:

Your doctor has reported that you have now reached maximum medical improvement (MMI) from your workers compensation injury, as of 07/16/2024.

Per Florida Statute 440.13 (14) (c), you will now be required to make a $10.00 co-payment on all future visits to your authorized physician. This $10.00 co-payment would not apply in the event the treatment rendered is in an emergency situation. Please note the statute of limitations for medical treatment is 2 years from the date of accident and one year from the date of last medical treatment.

Prior authorization is required for any follow up visits after MMI. If you need to return to the doctor, contact Anderson.

If you have any questions regarding this matter, please feel free to contact me.


Very truly yours,

Sarah Martinez

I was in the doctor's office until 11/12pm, that's close to 3 hours just for the appointment! The appointment was scheduled an hour from my home and 30 minutes from my school! That's an hour of driving alone! I need clarification because you said 10 days, so because of location and not knowing tests, waiting times, etc, I took the day! We are also not allowed to take less than 3 hours when requesting a sub."
299,2024-03-28 18:48:02,adjuster,"Good afternoon,

I am not sure if you already used your 10 in line of duty days? That is a question for your employer/risk management and not workers compensation. Workers compensation does not handle the coding and such.

We do have a mileage reimbursement form and you can get reimbursed for your mileage on appointments. There is a form in here under the documents section.

Does that somewhat help?"
299,2024-03-28 18:50:13,claimant,I have not used days. I have left for doctor appointments but returned after. I've only used the one day because I wasn't sure how long the appointment would be.
299,2024-03-28 18:50:36,claimant,The appointments have been 2-3 hours mid day

I was waiting to see if my pain would go away on its own. As you know I twisted the wrong way while picking up and moving a pre-k-rug that was heavy. I am hoping it's just a strain and not a tear of some kind. The paperwork I feel does not apply to me at this time because I haven't seen a dr and I am working every day at school. I also was concerned and confused about filling the paperwork out about the past 10 years of drs l have seen which has nothing to do with school . Can you please let me know your thoughts on all this stuff. I was going to wait another week or so to give it some time to see if things get better before checking it out. Looking forward in hearing from you. Thanks!
325,2022-08-19 18:04:05,adjuster,Hello Jane! We have all injured workers fill out the med auth just incase it is needed at a later date to request records. Please let me know if you end up seeking medical treatment and if you do not I can close your claim. Thank you.
325,2022-08-19 20:00:55,claimant,Hello Sarah! Just wanted to let you know that I have never filled out any paperwork like this. A child broke my toe last year and I went to the MedFirst then to the drs where I continued to go till it was completely healed and they discharged me. All the bills were sent between the drs and the school to you where I never filled anything out. I continued to work through out the course of all of this. I plan on going to MedFirst next week if things are still the same to get an X-ray. Hopefully things will be fine. I know strains take awhile to heal if that's what the problem is. I can see if I'm out of work to fill it out but I am working. A lot of this does not pertain to me at this time. I will keep you posted if I go and get it checked out..

You do not need to worry about the pharmacy license number. If your pain does not change soon, you can go back to MedFirst to be seen again and will have a $10 copay since they have released you.

Dear Sarah R. Johnson:

Your doctor has reported that you have now reached maximum medical improvement (MMI) from your workers compensation injury, as of 06/12/2024.

Per Florida Statute 440.13 (14) (c), you will now be required to make a $10.00 co-payment on all future visits to your authorized physician. This $10.00 co-payment would not apply in the event the treatment rendered is in an emergency situation. Please note the statute of limitations for medical treatment is 2 years from the date of accident and one year from the date of last medical treatment.

Prior authorization is required for any follow up visits after MMI. If you need to return to the doctor, contact Johnson Insurance.

If you have any questions regarding this matter, please feel free to contact me.

Very truly yours,

Dear Sarah Johnson:

The purpose of this letter is to advise you that workers' compensation benefits are being paid to you regarding the above-referenced accident.

At the present time, we have not made a determination that your injury arose out of and in the course and scope of your employment and falls within the definition of an ""injury"" and/or ""accident"", according to the Florida workers' compensation statute.

The Florida statute allows us 120 days in which to complete our investigation of your injury.  As such, we are beginning payments without prejudice and without admitting liability.

This will allow us to conduct a good faith investigation and make a final determination within 120 days after the initial provision of compensation or benefits.

Once our investigation has been completed, we will notify you of our final decision.

Please contact me if you have any questions or wish to discuss this matter further.

Very truly yours,

Maria Rodriguez

There is nothing in the Statute that states you must complete the list of Doctors over the last 10 year period. We are a full care WC facility for Northern Valley School District. The completion of the forms prevents delays in obtaining optimal medical treatment for the specificity of the injured worker with certain medical conditions, prior history of medical treatment to the same body part, etc. Most specialists will NOT see a patient without a medical history. What is required is your signature on the fraud statement. That is a legality that doesn't only represent WC but Fraud in its entirety. Hope that helps."

396,2024-09-13 12:39:48,claimant,when i left the school board clinic they said someone would contact me to set up an appointment for an orthopedic doctor. this happened tuesday and and today is friday and still have not heard anything.
396,2024-09-13 13:20:47,adjuster,"Good morning,

I just checked your file and do not have the referral or the DWC-25. The DWC-25 is what lists your diagnosis and if there's restrictions.

Did the Central County School Board Clinic provide you with that paperwork? Everything gets faxed to me from the employee clinic, but does not come right away. Our faxes go to a hub, then gets distributed accordingly to the assigned adjuster.

I can ask the employee health clinic to fax it again.

Sorry for the delay. That is why you have not heard anything.

Thank you,

Dear JAMES SMITH:

The purpose of this letter is to advise you that workers' compensation benefits are being paid to you regarding the above-referenced accident.

At the present time, we have not made a determination that your injury arose out of and in the course and scope of your employment and falls within the definition of an 'injury' and/or 'accident', according to the Florida workers' compensation statute.

The Florida statute allows us 120 days in which to complete our investigation of your injury. As such, we are beginning payments without prejudice and without admitting liability.

This will allow us to conduct a good faith investigation and make a final determination within 120 days after the initial provision of compensation or benefits.

Once our investigation has been completed, we will notify you of our final decision.

Please contact me if you have any questions or wish to discuss this matter further.

I need for you to contact me so that we can discuss the claim in more detail. Please contact me at 800-555-1234, x4567. In addition, if you could go back to the earlier email/text sent from ACME it has a link that you can select and activate your portal access.

415,2023-10-30 23:43:30,claimant,"Jane,

First I filled out the first document. I listed two of the doctors I have seen in the last ten years. I did not list ALL 10 years of doctor visits because I don't believe this is relevant information. The system prompts you to review it and then gives you an icon to sign it electronically - which I have now done. On the other hand the medicare document is not prompting me for an electronic signature."
415,2023-10-31 1:50:00,adjuster,"Again, I cannot see your side of the portal. On page 2 there should be a signature line. Try to click on the line and see if it permits you to type in a signature if not, look on the top of the document for a pen or signature title. Is it an Adobe document?

Also, I need to set up a time for me to conduct an initial contact with you. During that contact, I will have more information whereas I can better direct you in terms of prior medical history. It should take at the most 20 minutes.

We have never been able to connect for me to conduct an initial contact with you. I was going through your claim to close it for that reason when I came across a note from your physician that you had been ordered an MRI. I had no way of knowing that because there was never a referral attached. Today, I went to MedFirst portal and searched through and found the MRI referral.

How is your back doing? If you are still having issues, I would like to schedule the MRI and try and pick up where we left off back in October with an interview. We can conduct the interview directly through here. We can schedule a time, but first I am going to schedule the MRI.

Please check your phone as the diagnostic scheduler will be contacting you for a prescreen for the MRI (Spanish speaker). Once we have secured your appointment, we will get together for the interview.

Let me know if you are NOT interested or in need of the MRI asap so that we do not get charged, otherwise I will be texting/emailing with you shortly.

Have a continued wonderful winter break/Holiday!

426,2024-05-01 15:48:35,claimant,"Hi Mrs. Smith,

I have a CD copy of my MRI and I was wondering if I need to provide that to any additional physicians. As of Monday, April 29, Riverdale Medical had not received any results or feedback from ClearView Imaging regarding the MRI (which was late Friday so I wasn't surprised). I am concerned that it will be 4 weeks post-injury before anyone actually looks at imaging of the injury to determine an accurate diagnosis. As of now they are treating it as a wrist sprain, but one of the doctors at Riverdale Medical said it could be a fracture, possibly a ligament/tendon tear, which would indicate a different treatment protocol. I'm no spring chicken anymore and I can't afford to have long term effects due to misdiagnosis or improper treatment protocol.

All that being said, are the physicians at Riverdale Medical communicating with you what the treatment plan is? I really like the facility and the people there but worry about the lack of imaging and urgency to figure out exactly what the extent of the injury is.

Any feedback or guidance is much appreciated! If I just need to be more patient I can do that 😊

Thank you so much,

Sarah"

I have a question,

I have gotten my scheduling complete for Physical Therapy and for the MRI.

I noticed the MRI says for my knee this is the entire Knee and below that hurts I have said this from the start. Te knee really does not hurt it is around the sides and back of the knee and then below the knee. Are they going to do the MRI for the entire area or what, it says just the knee?

I just wanted to double check before next Wednesday August 28th at 630 AM is my appt time.

Thank you kindly,

I did not take the rapid release Tylenol this morning so that at the apptmt I could tell them exactly where I hurt and the pain level etc.  right now at 11:30 the exact middle of my forehead aches badly and I am incredibly naseaus. This isn't an increase in pain. I just didn't mask it. It has been 12 days since I had the fall. Is it normal to still have a headache in that place? How long does a concussion last and can be shown on a CT scan. My vision is not as blurry and I am definitely not as spacy. Just wanted to ask. I need to return to work on Thursday.  Thank you."
483,2023-01-16 17:11:04,adjuster,"Hi Ms. Smith, 

I am sorry that you are still experiencing discomfort; however, you appear to be on the right track as you indicate decreased vision involvement and less ""spacy"" feeling. Regarding recovery time, each individual is different, but most recover within weeks, but some can take months to wholly by without symptoms. I have reminders set to follow up on CT results.

566,2025-01-24 15:04:10,adjuster,"I should receive the referral today.   In the interim, I need to conduct and ""initial contact"" to get all the preliminary facts together.
Once I submit the referral, I normally get a schedule within that day depending on what time it is transmitted.  However, just so that you are prepared, WC physicians only carve out a proportioned period where they will only take new WC patients.   Right now the ortho surgeons/specialists are scheduling late Feb - Early March.  They are very good to me though, so hopefully we get an earlier appt.  When is a good time that we can connect?  It will take approx 30-40 minutes depending on the extent of the injury. 

Thank you.

Dear Sarah Jane Thompson:

The purpose of this letter is to advise you that workers' compensation benefits are being paid to you regarding the above-referenced accident.

At the present time, we have not made a determination that your injury arose out of and in the course and scope of your employment and falls within the definition of an ""injury"" and/or ""accident"", according to the Florida workers' compensation statute.

The Florida statute allows us 120 days in which to complete our investigation of your injury. As such, we are beginning payments without prejudice and without admitting liability.

This will allow us to conduct a good faith investigation and make a final determination within 120 days after the initial provision of compensation or benefits.

Once our investigation has been completed, we will notify you of our final decision.

Please contact me if you have any questions or wish to discuss this matter further.

Very truly yours,

Maria Rodriguez

Why are they asking for a wage earnings report. I didn't miss work. Also, I only have Medicare and no supplemental yet. I will get that once I retire. Just the Medicare A gives me nothing....only if I stayed overnight in the hospital.. I also received a $2000.00 medical bill from the hospital. I looks like the insurance paid...just not the deductible and co-pay. Who will be paying this and when ?Please advise me as I have not a clue, on what to tell hospital billing. They told me that I had to talk to you and that they did not advise me sending you the bill. They wanted you to call. I left the phone number on your recording, the other day. Thanks.... and have a good weekend.

Dear SARAH M. JOHNSON:

The purpose of this letter is to advise you that workers' compensation benefits are being paid to you regarding the above-referenced accident.

At the present time, we have not made a determination that your injury arose out of and in the course and scope of your employment and falls within the definition of an ""injury"" and/or ""accident"", according to the Florida workers' compensation statute.

The Florida statute allows us 120 days in which to complete our investigation of your injury. As such, we are beginning payments without prejudice and without admitting liability.

This will allow us to conduct a good faith investigation and make a final determination within 120 days after the initial provision of compensation or benefits.

Once our investigation has been completed, we will notify you of our final decision.

Please contact me if you have any questions or wish to discuss this matter further.

657,2024-09-10 14:58:04,claimant,"Good morning, Sarah..... I tried to message you back regarding Claim #4589765 last week, but it was closed out. The Dr. recommended me to complete the assigned PT. When I spoke with the PT Office, they were concerned that the case was closed and would not honor the PT. Also, as I informed the Dr. I am between 90-95% health, however I still have pain, a when moving certain directions and at times, being at rest. I am investigating (out of pocket) a second opinion from the Palmer Institute in Orlando. They are one of the Few offices that specialize in this type of injury. As you know, I have been concerned about this injury and evaluation from the start. It just took time to find an Office that knows what to look for."
657,2024-09-11 13:54:44,adjuster,"Hi Robert,

I saw on the office visit notes from Dr. Stevens that you are to finish the PT course. I did let MEDSYS know that you need to get this PT completed.

Since you have reached MMI (maximum medical improvement) with Dr. Stevens. You can go back and set a post MMI appointment with Dr. Stevens, which would be a $10 copay. I am sorry to hear that you're still in pain. Yes I do know about your concerns most definitely."

The location that I have been going to has been purchased by another company and they were requesting a new approval. I was not seen as a precaution and am reaching out to see what I need to do.

Dear SARAH MARTINEZ:

Once our investigation has been completed, we will notify you of our final decision.

Please contact me if you have any questions or wish to discuss this matter further.

Approximately thirty-six hours after my June 4, 2024 surgery, I experienced symptoms that I believed to be related to a heart attack. FirstResponse Ambulance Service transported me to the ER at Clearwater Regional Hospital. After a CT scan, the physicians determined that I had anesthesia-related pneumonia; therefore, my trip to the ER was due to a post-surgical complication.

MedCorp needs to send me or FirstResponse a check for $944.24 as soon as possible. Let me know how you will resolve this matter."

Is there another PT provider that can be utilized for an earlier appointment? This particular provider is also over 9 miles from where I work.
696,2024-05-03 21:10:17,supervisor,Hi – HealthNet looks at multiple facilities so that was likely the one with the soonest appointment. You can contact them back and ask for a different provider. We do reimburse your mileage.
696,2024-05-10 19:06:05,claimant,"Good afternoon

I went to my physical therapy appointment today. Before i left the PT office i tried to schedule my next appointment. I was told that today's appointment was the only one authorized by workman's comp and therefore i could not schedule any more at this time. Any guidance regarding this is appreciated.

Thank you"

Dear Mercy Health ER:

We received notice that balance due statements are being sent regarding services rendered to the employee for their workers' compensation injury.

Please refer to pages 8 and 9 of the Florida Reimbursement Manual. An authorized health care provider must be reimbursed for the services solely by the carrier (except for payments from third parties who have been determined to be liable for such payment).

If a provider's charge is greater than the maximum reimbursement allowance, the patient must not be billed for the difference. If a provider renders a service that is not reimbursable under workers' compensation, the provider may not charge the patient for the service, unless the patient understands that the service is not covered and has agreed to personally pay for the service.

In accordance with the above, please discontinue sending balance due statements to the patient.

Please send all further correspondence, including bills, to this address:

740,2025-02-11 13:24:15,adjuster,"Good morning Michael,

I was reaching out to see if you sought medical treatment for your injury?"
740,2025-02-11 13:24:43,claimant,Yeas I did! So sorry I forgot to text you
740,2025-02-11 13:24:58,claimant,"I saw the doctor on Saturday, and I'm scheduled to go back Monday"
740,2025-02-11 13:27:25,adjuster,"No worries. Okay thank you for letting me. Next Monday, 02/17/25 is your next appointment? 
How did it go?"
740,2025-02-11 13:30:50,claimant,"Well the doctor doesn't seem to think it's an ACL or MCL tear, he thinks it's a sprain most likely. Their x ray machine is broken, so they have to schedule me somewhere else. That is after my appointment with the physical therapist on Monday"
740,2025-02-11 13:44:11,adjuster,"Thankfully you did not tear your ACL or MCL. Yes that's correct about the x-ray machine.
Do you have the x-ray order on hand by any chance? If could, would you mind uploading it through here as a photo? For diagnostic scheduling we use MedView Imaging. They receive the order and reach out to you via phone call for the scheduling.

Trying to help with making this go smoothly for you. Also, do not forget to get the CD from the diagnostic facility of the x-ray images as well as the report."
740,2025-02-11 13:45:22,claimant,"I do have that, but I'm at work right now. I probably won't get home till very late tonight. I can definitely send it to you tomorrow if that's alright?"
740,2025-02-11 13:46:57,adjuster,Yes of course that will be alright.

742,2023-06-28 14:45:01,claimant,"Hello Sarah,

I left you a voicemail last Friday 6/23 after I spoke with the Urgent Care place I had gone to for my injury. I had called them to get a referral to see an Orthopedist. They told me that I need to contact my w/c claims adjuster for the referral as the doctor does not see a need for me to go. I was not happy with that response. The last visit I had at that Urgent care place the doctor just went over my MRI results. They did not examine me or ask me anything about my pain. They basically told me I have arthritis and nothing more they can do. Again, they never asked me how I was feeling (pain wise) that day or examined me. I see on their paperwork they handed me on the way out they have it stated that my pain has resolved. THAT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT THE CASE AT ALL. So I am not happy. I have pain and have had pain since the day of the incident. I did NOT have any issues before. I have pain everyday, as I am typing this to you now my hand is kiling me. No Joke!! When I use my mouse, my hand hurts, when I (to be polite I will state it this way) when I use the 'facilities' the motion of cleaning myself hurts my hand. This is not a joke I did not have these issues before and now I do and they want to blame it on arthritis that I have but it did not bother me before this incident. I was having breakfast and I couldn't even hold a cup of coffee without supporting it with my other hand when drinking it. When I use my computer, my calculator etc. at work, my hand hurts. Am I working?? Yes, BUT it Hurts and it didn't before and I have just kind of been left with no solution at this point. All I did was hold the door open for somebody trying to be polite and this is how I am left?? I don't get it. Any help you can provide would be very much appreciated!! Thank you for your time, Sarah. Sincerely, Jane Smith"
742,2023-06-28 20:33:06,supervisor,"hello Ms Smith,
I have requested the last office notes from the provider. We are in receipt of your MRI findings which did show no acute findings but a lot of degenerative changes. The physician can only rely on the objective medical findings. You can exercise your right for a one-time change in physician. We would need this signed request from you in writing. Once received, we will refer you to another walk-in facility in network."
742,2023-06-30 15:49:55,claimant,Can you provide me the address to whom I would send this to please or would I be able to upload it on the website?

I'm allowed to sit, but since my foot isn't elevated it's already started to throb and it's only 9:42. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated."

1) The appointment that was made for me today is conflicting with our last thespian meeting of the school year. Is there anyway that I could get it switched to a different time?
2) Dr. Smith does not seem to have the best ratings online. Dr. Roberts (with the same practice) seems to be more understandable, from what I can see online. Is there any way I could switch? Thanks so much.

(my phone is on do not disturb mode while I'm teaching, so it's easier to reach me here. I'll be keeping a window open. :))"

Yes, I reported to them.

10 May 2024 at 2115

Medic 22 was dispatched to interfacility transfer at Memorial Hospital. Upon arrival, the truck was parked and left running while EMS personnel went to retrieve the patient being transferred. The patient was placed safely onto the ambulance by stretcher. I noticed the vehicle was off after we had the truck running initially, so I turned on the vehicle, and after a few minutes of the truck running the truck started to smoke heavily at 2115 on May 10, 2024. I turned off the truck and proceeded to help get the patient out of the truck and notify the EMS 103 supervisor. Another unit was dispatched (medic 21) to transfer our patient to the receiving facility while I was told to take the truck back to the garage and switch out for truck 3050. Acknowledging the fact that the truck still presented smoke and a terrible burning smell. EMT Basic Rodriguez and I drove the truck and while en route to the garage, the vehicle stayed smoking with the burning smell, even with the windows down in the truck. Upon arrival at the garage, the equipment had to have been transferred to the receiving truck. Smoke was still prominent as I continued to get gear out of that truck and give it to my partner for her to put it on the new truck. My partner at the time also had a headache, just not as severe as my symptoms. After transferring the gear to the new truck we had parked the old truck. We were dispatched to another interfacility transfer from Memorial Hospital to City General Hospital. I did notify the supervisor that I did not feel well at 2220 about symptoms. After arriving at Memorial Hospital, I spoke with the Charge nurse Susan Wilson about my signs and symptoms while waiting for additional paperwork to transport the patient from the hospital staff. Before, during, and after that call my symptoms worsened with one of the worst headaches I have ever had. My throat and eyes began to hurt with a burning sensation. After transferring the patient EMS 103 supervisor was made aware of the situation by my partner and myself. I stated to EMS 103 Supervisor that I would continue to monitor for worsening effects and notify him in the morning about my status. After arriving at EMS base around 1230am and finishing the PCR, I had my own personal OTC Tylenol at 0100 on May 11, 2024, I took one tablet which was 500mg, and continued to stay hydrated with water.

After sleeping for a about nearly 5 hours due to no calls from dispatch, I woke up feeling very bad. My headache was not as severe however my throat burned. I was notified by EMS 102 Assistant Chief about completing a Worker's Compensation form and detailed statement. I did contact the Assistant Chief about my signs and symptoms worsening and that I would be going to Pine Valley Medical Center by my home due to Employee Health being closed for the weekend. I explained to the doctor about what had happened and requested advice on my throat since my chest pain had subsided. I had no chest pain when arriving to Pine Valley Medical Center in Rivertown, NC. The doctor stated that I had some smoke inhalation and irritation. The doctor advised that I stay away from any form of smoke for 2-3 days and that I should stay hydrated, take some Tylenol for pain, and rest. There was nothing the doctor could do to help with the irritation, he stated that it should go away in a few days. I notified the Assistant Chief of the ER visit. He stated to get some rest and submit the paperwork as soon as possible.

A follow-up appointment has not been made due to my signs and symptoms improved. I am feeling alot better and i am able to return to work. I am a part time employee and the next scheduled shift was scheduled on May 19th for 12hrs.

I have a medical history of back and neck pain due to military service. I have a history of anxiety.

No, I have no concurrent employment."

But nevertheless, we quickly went over my injury that I've had for years and he was supposed to put an order in for the Nurtec and some how that never took place. So I'm still waiting and praying that I do not have another Migraine episode I will try to reach out to his office again. Maybe it was over looked. Thank you"

I saw late last night that you responded to an insight that you were truly still suffering at the shoulder. The attending physician has released you back to full duty and assigned you to MMI (Maximum Medical Improvement).

If you are still having issues with your shoulder, I implore you to revisit MedFirst today and let them know that you are not at MMI and need more treatment.

I have not closed your claim as yet because I wanted to reach out to you first and give you my best recommendation in terms of continued medical care.

Let me know what they say. If you elect not to return to MedFirst, I will have no alternative but to close your claim.

Good luck and let me know how you fare!"

877,2024-08-29 18:47:13,adjuster,Yes Ma'am.  I will email you a blank copy that way you can print as many as you need! Is jsmith@pcsb.org a good email address to send it to?
877,2024-08-29 18:47:17,claimant,"This website says that you don't have my phone number which is incorrect.  Additionally, when I tried to enter it, the message said the number is already taken.  So I am unable to update the profile.  My cell number is 555-123-4567."
877,2024-08-29 18:49:58,claimant,"Thank you for your response.  No, that isn't a valid address anymore.  I retired due to the injuries so you have to use my personal address.  jane.smith@email.com.  There are a lot of visits and your form isn't exactly efficient.  That will be a ton of writing.  Can I just say where I went instead of writing the entire address each time-that is rather ridiculous.  Also, what about tolls?  I had to take toll roads for some of my visits."
877,2024-08-29 18:55:25,adjuster,"Ok, I have emailed the form to that email address. If you are going to the same doctors office each time you do not need to list the entire address each time. You can just write down the doctors name. If you have the receipts for the tolls and can include them with the mileage form then yes, we will reimburse for those. However, we cannot reimburse for tolls if you do not provide a receipt."
877,2024-08-29 18:57:48,claimant,Thank you.  I  use a sunpass and the account is my husband's so would copies of the bills suffice?

He has told me that I have to have procedures done for my pain management treatment and that I need to have transportation for each of these visits. It is too much to ask my family to constantly be taking me to Springfield to receive these treatments.

Dear Sarah Jane Miller:

The purpose of this letter is to advise you that workers' compensation benefits are being paid to you regarding the above-referenced accident.

At the present time, we have not made a determination that your injury arose out of and in the course and scope of your employment and falls within the definition of an 'injury' and/or 'accident', according to the Florida workers' compensation statute.

The Florida statute allows us 120 days in which to complete our investigation of your injury. As such, we are beginning payments without prejudice and without admitting liability.

This will allow us to conduct a good faith investigation and make a final determination within 120 days after the initial provision of compensation or benefits.

Once our investigation has been completed, we will notify you of our final decision.

Please contact me if you have any questions or wish to discuss this matter further.

My follow up appointment to see how my wrist is doing is tomorrow at 4:45pm. I received a message from my principal's secretary that something wasn't going to be covered for it. 
Can I have more information on that. 
I also realized that I have an important training at 5:30 tomorrow. If I don't go to the follow up, does that mess up my workers comp?  I am confused on what is being covered."

Your appointments will be covered by workers compensation. However, you will not be paid for any time you miss from work for clinic appointments made during work hours. If you are referred to a specialist, your time will be covered for the specialist appointments. If you are not able to make the appointment today that is fine.

I see in the portal that you are now the adjuster handling my claim. I had previously been working with Mark Thompson. As you will see in the email below, in December I had a consult with a neurosurgeon. At that time, he determined that I would need to follow up with him on June 27 with a new MRI (with contrast).

Subject: Latest Update

Hello Mr. Thompson,

I'm pleased to report that the follow-up with the surgeon went well yesterday. He is hopeful that no further treatment will be necessary, but he indicated that he can't be certain of that until a repeat MRI is done in six months. I will have a follow up with him in June to discuss the findings of that MRI.

I also saw a doctor for my workers' comp follow-up at City Medical yesterday. They indicated that they won't need to continue seeing me.

Please let me know if there is any other information I can provide.

Thanks.

Respectfully,

John R. Wilson"

I had a reminder set to scheduled the MRI prior to your appt on 6/27/23 with Dr. Roberts. I will just forward that now to get it scheduled and we can forward the report to Dr. Roberts when completed. You may want to call the office of Dr. Roberts and see if he would like you to bring in the MRI disk with you to your appt. As this you will need to request and pick up to take with you. You should be receiving a call within the next couples days to schedule the MRI. Let me know if you have not by the end of next week. Thank you, Sarah."

If MedRite tries to only authorize 3 days again or some other issue, just reach out to me and I will try to take care of it so you can get the full amount.

928,2022-10-12 6:22:15,claimant,"Hey Robert
I went to the Memorial City ER last Thursday to be checked for the injury as well as getting 2 medications the next day. I don't have any hospital bills at the moment though since the visit was just the other day. Is there anything I need to do? Also, I've been having a lot of back pain since the incident, so I planned to make an appt at SMC to make sure nothing is wrong."
928,2022-10-12 14:47:48,adjuster,"Good morning Sarah,

I am very sorry to hear that you are in pain. The process for seeing SMC is that a work comp authorized provider needs to refer you to orthopedics. If you schedule an appointment on your own it will not be authorized and therefore will not be paid. You adjuster will contact you today to complete an initial contact and go over any questions you have. Thank you!"
928,2022-10-12 15:27:05,claimant,"Good morning. How do I find a workers comp provider to go see? I'm in a lot of pain at the moment so the sooner I can be seen, the better!"
928,2022-10-12 17:26:09,adjuster,"Hi Sarah,  I have made two attempts to reach you by phone leaving a voicemail each time. We need to complete an initial contact and I would like to answer your questions about seeing an authorized provider. Could you please return my call at 800-555-1234 extension 6109 or message me back to schedule a time for this initial contact, it takes about 20-30 minutes. Thank you!"
928,2022-10-17 17:22:13,claimant,Hey Maria. I'm sorry we have not been able to get in touch. Could we possibly schedule the phone call for Wednesday afternoon sometime?
928,2022-10-17 20:12:07,adjuster,"Hi Sarah,

Wednesday afternoon would be perfect. It should take about 30 minutes. Is there a particular time that works best for me to call you?"
928,2022-10-17 20:12:50,claimant,Does 2 pm work?
928,2022-10-17 20:14:52,adjuster,"That sounds great! I will call you on Wednesday 10/19/2022 at 2:00 pm to complete an initial contact for both of your claims.
I look forward to speaking with you. If you need anything between now and then please let me know. Thank you!"

929,2024-09-19 16:50:39,claimant,"Rachel, the PT provider wants to know if I have a follow up scheduled with Dr. Thompson once my PT is completed next week."
929,2024-09-19 17:17:55,adjuster,Follow up appointments are to be scheduled by you with the office.

I did pursue getting blood allergy tests done which came out negative.  Apparently I do not recall the medical term but the stress of the accident induced an anaphylactic shock (which resulted in severe respiratory difficulty)  for which I went to Meadowbrook Hospital 2 hours later which subsequently tripped my heart into AFIB and forced a several day stay in ICU.  You have access to all of my records including the Allergy tests done.  it was noted because it was so unusual and my regime is pretty rigid so it made no sense what caused such a severe allergic reaction."
